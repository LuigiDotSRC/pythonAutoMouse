## Description: 
pyautogui library documentation: https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Uses the pyautogui library to control the user's cursor through code. 
Tkinter and ttkbootstrap work together to bring the user GUI. The GUI allows the user to easily configure their experience using the program without having to interact with the terminal. From the GUI, the user can select from three preset options to run the program and set the amount of iterations and delay. 

- Option 1: Mouse will move to the corners of the screen and click 
- Option 2: Mouse will automatically click at the center of the screen (smallest offset: 4cps)
- Option 3: Mouse will move left to right 5 pixels periodically
